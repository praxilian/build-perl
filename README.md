# Build Perl

Build one or more perl binaries.

Leave the system perl for the system and escape its single-release
multi-threaded trappings.  Now it's even easier to compile perl binaries for
your application code.  Just say what you want (5.22.1) and where you want it
(/opt/perl) then run get_perl.sh to deliver it.
